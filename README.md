# Tech Test 

The brief was;

```
Write a program that can accept the CSV and output an array of people, splitting the name into
the correct fields, and splitting multiple people from one string where appropriate. The task
should take no longer than 2 hrs.
```

Technologies used;
```
* Laravel
* Tailwind
```

I approached the task by creating a simple frontend using Laravel/Tailwind for the uploading of the
file, and created a Service for uploading files through tests.
